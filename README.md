Preview at https://sergiorivera.me/vue-search-jobs/ 

I had some CORS errors while trying to get Username details so I am getting throught a PHP page.

I am using https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-types by the way to simplify access to Vuex store from components

Thanks

### Nice to have

- Full Models or Interfaces: Since its a demo I did not create all the models or interface for full typed code
- Show all the data from details: There is a lot of information mostly at User Details that I did not include is this short time
- Unit test: I am not including any Unit Test, I do JEST but I gotta say that I am not an "experto" doing them with Vue components **BUT** with due time and experience I can learn to implement them quickly.
