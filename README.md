# vue-job-searching
Will search for Jobs or people (users)

Made by Sergio Rivera with Vue, Vuex, Vuetify and Typescript:


Due to my current projects, I am not able to finish template (pretty template) page details for User and Job Details.

CORS errors while trying to get Username details

I am sorry, I don't have the time to finish tweaks, optimization, etc, due to my daily job.

Thanks
